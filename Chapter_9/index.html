    <h2 style="text-shadow: 1px 2px 2px rgb(49, 49, 49); ">Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing (PIAIC)</h2>
    <p>The mission of PIAIC is to reshape Pakistan by revolutionizing education, research, and business by adopting latest, cutting-edge technologies. Experts are calling this the 4th industrial revolution. We want Pakistan to become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud native computing, edge computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and internet of things.</p>

    <h1>Cloud Native</h1>
    <p>Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.</p>
    <h1>Block Chain</h1>
    <p>In this module students will be introduced to the programming and development side of Blockchain, especially that of Ethereum. The students will learn how to use a Remix IDE to program in Solidity. The students will go over various Blockchain concepts again such as Blockchain Basics, Blockchain Transactions, and Blockchain Blocks. The students will learn the infrastructural concepts of the Ethereum Blockchain, such as The Ethereum Virtual Machine, how Ethereum Accounts are formed and how Ethereum Transactions occur. They will also go over other concepts like Gas, Storage, Memory and the Stack, Instruction Set, Message Calls, Delegatecall / Callcode and Libraries, Logs, Creating contracts, and Self-destruct.</p>
    <h1>Internet of things</h1>
    <p>oT devices are implemented using both hardware and software components. Dedicated hardware components are used to implement the interface with the physical world, and to perform tasks which are more computationally complex. Microcontrollers are used to execute software that interprets inputs and controls the system. This module discusses the roles of both the hardware and software components in the system.</p>
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p> In <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> Linux containers are poised to take over the world. In this module, students will begin learning with an introduction of Linux and the command line interface. For many non-technical people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, knowledge of only a handful of basic commands is enough to start feeling comfortable. In this module, we will cover the basic commands to get you started.
